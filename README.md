S.E.E.D works on the principle of hashing. A concept that is based on a modulus operator, functioned by a key. S.E.E.D designs a matrix, similar to the one made by the captcha, by taking the size of the matrix and the colors used as inputs from the user. A standard key is selected for the filling of the matrix in the form a hash table.

Digitalization and Cyber Crime go hand in hand. As the world is going online, so is the crime. S.E.E.D is an initiative to get rid of this problem. Our current online security system, though pretty efficient, can still be improved. S.E.E.D aims at just that. 

The current system of online security consists of username-password along with captcha. But S.E.E.D provides  an additional security interface, acting as a two way authentication system, which gives additional security to the user, keeping unwanted guests at bay.

The concept, though currently simple, can be seen as very efficient. It can further be improved by the use of more complex knowledge. But currently still, S.E.E.D can be very efficient to improve online security.
