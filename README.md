S.E.E.D works on the principle of hashing. A concept that is based on a modulus operator, functioned by a key. S.E.E.D designs a matrix, similar to the one made by the captcha, by taking the size of the matrix and the colors used as inputs from the user. A standard key is selected for the filling of the matrix in the form a hash table.
